# DemoUK_Road_Safety_Insights_Dashboard


An interactive Excel dashboard project analyzing road accident data across the UK. This demo simulates a real-world reporting scenario for the Ministry of Transport. It showcases data cleaning, pivot table analysis, slicers, and custom visualizations to uncover trends, accident causes, and high-risk locations.

This is a demo project designed to showcase my Excel data analysis and dashboard creation skills. The project analyzes road accident data in the UK, helping uncover patterns that could guide safety interventions and policies.

## Understanding the Problem
Road traffic accidents remain a critical public safety concern in the UK. Factors like road types, speed limits, lighting, and weather conditions all contribute to accident rates. With thousands of records available, it's often challenging for stakeholders—like policymakers and transport authorities—to quickly interpret and act on raw data.



## Project Goal
To create a clean, insightful, and interactive dashboard using Excel that simplifies the analysis of road accident data. The aim was to identify trends, accident hotspots, and risk factors, enabling stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions.

 
 ## What I Did
--Data Familiarization

Explored a publicly available dataset from Kaggle

Researched unfamiliar fields using articles and YouTube tutorials

--Data Cleaning

Removed duplicate entries

Standardized categorical variables

Fixed spelling inconsistencies

Handled missing values

-- Data Modeling

Built multiple PivotTables to summarize:

Accidents by road type, light/weather conditions, vehicle involvement

Casualties by location and severity

Speed limits vs accident counts

--Dashboard Creation

Designed a fully interactive Excel dashboard using:

Slicers for filtering

Pivot Charts for analysis

Conditional formatting to highlight key values

Thoughtful color choices to improve user experience

## Dashboard Overview
The final Excel dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of over 400,000 road accident records. Users can interact with filters to drill down into specifics like accident type, road condition, location, and more. Built entirely in Excel, it showcases the power of spreadsheet tools for business intelligence.

## Key Insights
417,000+ casualties recorded between 2021–2022

84% were slight injuries, 2% were fatalities

Cars were involved in over 80% of all casualties

Most accidents occurred on single carriageways and in urban cities like Birmingham, Leeds, and Manchester

Surprisingly, most incidents happened in daylight and on dry roads, pointing toward behavioral rather than environmental causes
